**Plugins Issues:** The plugins feature has failed and will either be reworked or removed completely. For more information, please check the [Announcement](https://github.com/IntellegixLabs/WebCYAM-HTMLOS-Full/releases?q=Announcement+&expanded=true) page.
## Plugins
# PLUGIN ONLY WORKS FOR LATEST RELEASE, GET IT IN THE RELEASES TAB.
It is possible to install plugins for HTML OS, even if its custom made.
All you need to do is add snippnets of code into the `htmlos-1.0.htm` file:

`````html
<div id="./Plugins/YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME"></div>
<script>
        fetch('YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME') // Load XML file
            .then(response => response.text())
            .then(xmlString => {
                let parser = new DOMParser();
                let xmlDoc = parser.parseFromString(xmlString, "application/xml");
                let content = xmlDoc.querySelector("content").textContent;
                document.getElementById("xmlContent").innerHTML = content;
            })
            .catch(error => console.error("Error loading XML:", error));
</script>

`````
If the plugin comes with an overlay, add this:
`````css
        .overlay {
            position: fixed;
            top: 20%;
            left: 30%;
            background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
            color: white;
            padding: 20px;
        }
`````
Change the CSS file however you want, if you know what you are doing.
Replace `YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME` with your actual plugin name.

## How to make a plugin
To make a plugin all you need is an XML file, it should look like this:
````xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<data>
    <content>
        <![CDATA[
            <div class="overlay">
                <h2>Hello from XML!</h2>
                <p>This content is loaded dynamically.</p>
            </div>
        ]]>
    </content>
</data>

````
Feel free to edit the provided scripts to match your requirements.
If you plugin has an overlay, please remember to add an `overlay` class like this

````html
<div class="overlay"></div>
````
Please note that making a HTML OS plugin requires general HTML and XML knowledge.
